## 🖼️ Multimodal AI Chatbot: Image Understanding, Generation & Editing
This project demonstrates a powerful multimodal chatbot that can intelligently understand images, generate new images from text prompts, and even edit existing images based on user instructions. Built using modern deep learning APIs and frameworks, it blends computer vision and natural language processing into one seamless conversational interface.

### 📌 Objective
- To develop an AI-powered chatbot that supports the following capabilities:
- 🧠 Understands uploaded images (e.g., identifies objects, scenes, or describes context)
- 🖌️ Edits existing images based on user commands (e.g., “add a tree in the background”)
- 🎨 Generates new images from natural language prompts (e.g., “a futuristic city at sunset”)
- 💬 Provides intelligent, natural language responses to both image and text-based queries

## 💡 Key Features
Feature	Description
- 🖼️ Image Understanding	Extracts and explains objects, scenes, or concepts in uploaded images
- ✂️ Image Editing	Modifies images using user-defined textual instructions
- 🎨 Text-to-Image Generation	Creates images from creative prompts
- 🤖 Conversational UI	Chat-like interaction using text and images

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Gemini Models 
- Stable Diffusion for image generation and inpainting
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- PIL / OpenCV for image preprocessing
- Streamlit for building a web-based interface

### 🔐 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Google API Key or access to a vision-capable LLM
- Internet access (for API calls)

### 🧠 Behind the Scenes
- Vision models analyze uploaded images using deep CNNs + transformers.
- Text prompts are processed with LLMs (GPT-4 Vision or similar).
- Image generation leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality outputs.
- Editing works via inpainting using masked regions and prompts.
