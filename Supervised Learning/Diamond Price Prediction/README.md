## 💎 Diamond Price Prediction using Regression Algorithms
This project aims to predict the prices of diamonds based on their attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other features. Using historical diamond data, the project develops regression models to accurately estimate diamond prices, providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and appraisers.

### 🎯 Objective
The main goal is to create robust regression models that predict diamond prices using a combination of physical and quality features. The project also focuses on understanding which features most influence the price and improving model accuracy through tuning and evaluation.

### 🧰 Technologies Used
Language:
- Python

Libraries:
- numpy, pandas – Data processing and manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization and exploratory analysis
- statistics, math, scipy – Statistical computations
- scikit-learn – Building and evaluating regression models

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored distributions of diamond attributes such as carat weight, cut quality, color, and clarity
Visualized feature relationships and outliers impacting price
Encoded categorical features (cut, color, clarity) to numerical values for modeling
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare for regression analysis

### 🌲 Tree Visualization
Developed decision trees to interpret how features impact diamond price predictions
Analyzed feature importance to highlight key variables affecting pricing

### 🔍 Models Used
- Linear Regression – Baseline for understanding feature-price relationships
- Decision Tree Regressor – Captures non-linear patterns in the data
- Random Forest Regressor – Ensemble model for higher accuracy and reduced overfitting

### 🧪 Model Evaluation
Metrics used to assess model performance:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Random Forest Regressor achieved the best results with the lowest errors and highest R², indicating strong predictive power
