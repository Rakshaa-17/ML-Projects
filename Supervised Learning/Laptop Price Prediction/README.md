# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Regression Algorithms

This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as screen size, weight, processor type, and more. By analyzing historical laptop data, we aim to develop a model that can estimate prices accurately, helping consumers and retailers make informed decisions.

### 🎯 Objective

The primary objective is to build regression models that can predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. Through thorough analysis and model tuning, we aim to enhance prediction accuracy and uncover key price-influencing features.

### 🧰 Technologies Used

**Language:**  
- Python

**Libraries:** 
- `numpy`, `pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization  
- `scipy` – Statistical analysis  
- `scikit-learn` – Machine learning and evaluation  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explored relationships between laptop specifications and prices  
- Visualized distributions and outliers in key features  
- Cleaned and transformed data (e.g., converted weight and screen size to numeric formats)  
- Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`

### 🌲 Tree Visualization

- Created decision trees to illustrate how features impact price predictions  
- Used tree depth and feature importance metrics to interpret model behavior  

### 🔍 Models Used

- **Linear Regression** – For baseline price predictions  
- **Decision Tree Regressor** – To capture non-linear relationships  
- **Random Forest Regressor** – For improved performance through ensemble learning  

### 🧪 Model Evaluation

- Evaluation Metrics:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
  - **R² Score**  

- Performed **Grid Search** for hyperparameter tuning  
- Used **Cross-Validation** to ensure model generalization

### 🛠 Future Enhancements

- Integrate XGBoost or LightGBM for better predictive power  
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit as a web application  
- Allow dynamic user input for real-time price prediction
