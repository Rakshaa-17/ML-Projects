## Telecom Customer Churn Analysis ##

This project aims to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave our telecom services for a competitor). By analyzing company data and uncovering meaningful patterns, we aim to reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

#### 🎯 Objective ####
The primary objective is to detect potential churners by analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns. Based on insights drawn from the data, we can proactively address issues and retain valuable customers before they switch to competing telecom providers.

#### 🧰 Technologies Used Language ####
Python

#### 📎Libraries ####
numpy, pandas – Data manipulation matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization scipy – Statistical analysis scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

#### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ####
Analyzed customer demographics, service usage, and billing details Identified patterns associated with high churn probability

#### 📌Key insights ####
Monthly charges and contract type have strong correlation with churn Customers with short tenure are more likely to leave Long-term contracts reduce churn likelihood

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used Logistic Regression – For binary churn prediction Linear Regression – Used for exploratory purposes (e.g., analyzing billing trends), not for churn classification

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score Confusion matrix and ROC curve for performance visualization
