# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Services

This project aims to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave our telecom services for a competitor). By analyzing company data and uncovering meaningful patterns, we aim to reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

### 🎯 Objective

The primary objective is to detect potential churners by analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns. Based on insights drawn from the data, we can proactively address issues and retain valuable customers before they switch to competing telecom providers.

### 🧰 Technologies Used

**Language:**  
- Python

**Libraries:**  
- `numpy`, `pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization  
- `scipy` – Statistical analysis  
- `scikit-learn` – Machine learning models and evaluation  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed customer demographics, service usage, and billing details  
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and visualized distributions  
- Explored trends related to customer tenure, charges, contract types, and payment methods  

### 📌 Key Insights

- 📈 Monthly charges and contract type have a strong correlation with churn  
- ⏳ Customers with short tenure are significantly more likely to leave  
- 📉 Long-term contracts (1 or 2 years) help reduce churn likelihood  
- 🧾 Paperless billing and electronic payment methods also show patterns related to churn  

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression** – For binary churn classification (Yes/No)  
- **Linear Regression** – Used only for exploratory purposes (e.g., examining billing trends)  

### 🧪 Model Evaluation

- Evaluation Metrics:  
  - **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**  
- Visualization Tools:  
  - **Confusion Matrix**  
  - **ROC Curve**
  - 
### 🛠 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM  
- Create an automated alert system for high-risk churn customers  
- Deploy as a dashboard for business stakeholders to monitor customer health in real-time
