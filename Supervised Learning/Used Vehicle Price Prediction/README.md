## 🏥 Premium Insurance Prediction using Regression Algorithms
This project aims to predict medical insurance premiums based on personal and health-related attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. By analyzing historical insurance data, we aim to develop a model that can estimate premium charges accurately, aiding insurers in pricing and risk assessment.

### 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to build regression models that can predict the insurance premium (charges) based on various customer features. Through detailed analysis and model tuning, we aim to improve prediction accuracy and identify key factors that influence insurance costs.

### 🧰 Technologies Used
Language:
- Python

Libraries:

- numpy, pandas – Data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
- scikit-learn – Machine learning and evaluation

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed relationships between customer features and insurance charges
Visualized distributions and identified skewed data
Detected strong impact of smoking status, age, and BMI on premium
Converted categorical variables into numeric format using encoding techniques

### 🌲 Tree Visualization
Visualized decision paths using tree-based models
Analyzed feature importance in Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
Interpreted how smoking, age, and BMI influence predicted charges

### 🔍 Models Used
Linear Regression – Baseline model
Lasso & Ridge Regression – Regularization techniques
Random Forest Regressor – Ensemble model for better accuracy
Gradient Boosting Regressor – Best-performing model with strong predictive power

### 🧪 Model Evaluation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score

Used Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning
Applied Cross-Validation to improve generalization
