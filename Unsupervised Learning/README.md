## 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques
This project applies unsupervised learning to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using KMeans Clustering. The goal is to help businesses identify customer groups for personalized marketing and improved customer relationship management.

### 🎯 Objective
- Segment customers into distinct groups based on their transactional patterns
- Understand key characteristics of each customer group
- Provide actionable insights to support targeted marketing strategies

### 🧰 Technologies Used
Programming Language:
- Python

Libraries:

- pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
- scikit-learn – Clustering and preprocessing

### 📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned dataset by removing nulls and invalid entries
- Created RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value)
- Scaled data using StandardScaler for better clustering performance

### 🔍 Clustering Approach
- Applied KMeans Clustering to group customers
- Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Visualized clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction

### 🧪 Key Results
Successfully segmented customers into distinct behavioral clusters

- Identified groups such as:
- High-value frequent buyers
- Low-spending one-time buyers
- Occasional buyers with medium value
- These insights can drive personalized campaigns and loyalty strategies.
