## RAG Chatbot
A Retrievalâ€‘Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot implemented in a Jupyter notebook using transformerâ€‘based models and vector embedding search. This demo showcases how to build a Q&A assistant that retrieves relevant context from a document corpus before generating responses.

### ðŸš€ Features
- Document ingestion: Split text or files into manageable chunks and store them as embeddings in a vector store.
- Semantic retrieval: Given a user query, compute its embedding and fetch topâ€‘k relevant document chunks using similarity search.
- Generative Q&A: Provide the retrieved context + query to an LLM (e.g., Hugging Face or OpenAI) to generate accurate and contextâ€‘aware answers.
- Interactive notebook flow: Stepâ€‘byâ€‘step walkthroughâ€”from preprocessing to chat setupâ€”with real-time code execution and visual outputs.
